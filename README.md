# Brain Tumor Detection
 In this machine learning project, we build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) scan images . The performance of model is predict brain tumor is present or not. If the tumor is detected it return yes and some details about tumor, otherwise it return no.
